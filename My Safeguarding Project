**MY Safeguarding Project**
 **PLANNING**  

I watched a YouTube video on how to lay out a website, similar to how a newspaper used to be laid out, divided into rows and columns, rather than using wireframes. I found the wireframes program difficult to use.
I read the brief before starting, and I think I had a good understanding of what was required.

I used Copilot to create my User stories. Microsoft designed to create AI images for my website. I was 
having difficulties finding images.

I found this image on Google images for my initial colour palette. I know I wanted green in my website. I went for green as my main colour, as it is associated with safety.

**DURING THE PROJECT**

I started with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap boilerplate code. I used Google Fonts and Font Awesome for the icons.

I will say my coding knowledge is limited, having never coded before this project,  

I did use AI for the majority of this project, and I know the basic structure of my website
Navbar, Hero section, Key principles of safeguarding, A resource section with links to local charities and national services, e.g. Government, Age.UK
a contact form. 

I use the Bootstrap code for the navbar, jumbotron section, all the cards, contact form, and I also used code from the broadwalk games project, like some of the 
features she added when you clicked on contact, it would go to that section, so I added it to my site. Making sure the website works well
on mobiles, tablets and laptops, etc.

I use prompts in Copilot. I asked Copilot to limit the colour palette to green, orange, purple and black, white for the text.
